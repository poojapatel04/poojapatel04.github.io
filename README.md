Integrated a SQL database for secure storage and efficient retrieval of employee time records. Collaborated in a Scrum-based team, following Agile principles through two-week sprints, while enhancing the product backlog to address evolving requirements and functionality improvements.
-  **[Data Manipulation and Analysis in R](https://github.com/poojapatel04/Data-Manipulation-and-Analysis-in-R)**: Utilized R to analyze and manipulate a dataset on worm densities, soil pH, and vegetation types from various farms.
